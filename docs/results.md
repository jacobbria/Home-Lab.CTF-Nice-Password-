<h2>🛠️ a. Unauthorized Access</h2>

The server was accessed using a variation of a <strong>brute-force attack</strong>. While not a pure brute-force, it resembled a <strong>password spray</strong>, as a previously leaked version of the password was known to the attacker.

A custom script generated permutations of the known password and eventually guessed the correct version.

<blockquote><strong>🔒 Challenge:</strong><br>
Windows’ built-in account lockout settings locked the account after 10 failed attempts within 10 minutes.
</blockquote>

To bypass this, I gradually <strong>slowed down the login attempts with Hydra</strong>, carefully tuning the speed through trial and error — without looking at server settings. After successful login, I confirmed the lockout settings.

<h2>🔍 b. Locating Valuable Data</h2>

Since this was my <strong>first homemade CTF</strong>, I made the data easy to locate. A <code>.txt</code> file named <strong><code>passwords</code></strong> was found on the desktop, completely <strong>unencrypted</strong> and unprotected.

<blockquote><strong>💡 Note for future experiments:</strong><br>
Next iterations will involve obfuscation, misleading file names, and maybe encrypted archives to reflect a more security-conscious sysadmin.

<h2>🚚 c. Treasure Exfiltration</h2>

Exfiltrating the password list proved more educational than expected.

<ul>
<li>🖥 <strong>Using RDP:</strong><br>
RDP was enabled (a default in many Azure environments), so I was able to <strong>copy and paste the file directly</strong>. This method leaves <em>very little forensic trace</em>, making it hard for defenders to track.</li>

<li>🔐 <strong>Using SSH + SCP:</strong><br>
I also used <code>scp</code> to transfer the file. This is more <em>detectable</em>, as it leaves logs of file transfers that can be monitored.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote><strong>🎯 Lesson Learned:</strong><br>
RDP copy-paste is a stealthy method. SCP provides a cleaner workflow, but is more visible.

<h2>🧠 Conclusion</h2>

This experiment achieved its goals and gave me:

<ul>
  <li>A practical look at <strong>authentication security</strong> from both attacker and defender views.</li>
  <li>Insight into <strong>evading detection mechanisms</strong>.</li>
  <li>A better experience than prefab CTFs, since I had to <strong>design and troubleshoot</strong> my own challenge.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote><strong>🚀 Next Steps:</strong><br>
Make challenges progressively harder and implement real-world defensive controls. Every attack should have a possible detection path for Blue Team review.
