a. Unauthorized access to server: SUCCESS
b. Location of valuable data: SUCCESS
c. Exfil of treasure(s): SUCCESS

a. Unauthorized Access
  The server wwas able to accessed using a variation of Brute-force attack. Not a true brute-force in nature, 
it may be closer to a password spray as a previous leaked version was known to the attackers. The script making permutations on the known password
was able to guess a correct version.
  The largest issue was by-passing built in Windows defense mechanisms in which it locked the account after so many failed attempts. To get around this
I slowed down my hydra login attempts gradually. It took a few attempts, as I didnt want to cheat and look into my own servers settings, but eventually
I found the right pace. After this success I checked my servers default settings and found it was 10 attempts within 10 minutes.

----------------------------------------------------------

b. Locating Valuable Data
  This being my first home-made CTF, I made this easy. The .txt file was found in the desktop, labeled passwords, and unencryted in any manner. 
Future games/experiments will involved making this slighly more tricky as maybe the sys-admin wises up after this first breach.

--------------------------------------------------------
c. Treasure Exfil

  Exfiling the password list was not as easy as I first imagined. Using RDP, which many cloud providers such as Azure default enable, it was simple to
copy and paste the text file. In fact, this can make any forensics much harder to perform and find the exfil method. Using SSH I also used scp to 
get that data back home. This leaves better trace to be detected.

---------------- Conclusion ------------------------
  The goals of this experiment were accomplished. It gave me a greater understanding of how brute-force attacks are performed from both red & blue
team perspective. I enjoyed this much more than some standard CTF games as being in the driver seat of the situation made me troubleshoot and think
about what I wanted out of it. It's a good reference point to expand more experiments in the future.
